# Project Overview

### Use cases

TechBuddy AI: Smart Appliance Repair Assistant<br>

TechBuddy AI is a RAG LLM app for appliance repair pros. It offers:
- Instant, accurate help for repair challenges<br>
- Vast technical knowledge database<br>
- Context-aware assistance<br>
- Up-to-date repair info and expert knowledge<br>
- Improved efficiency and first-time fix rates<br>

Streamline your repair process with TechBuddy AI.

## Data Set

The data set contains various elements about appliances including:
- Type of appliance (Dishwasher,Refrigerator, etc .. )
- Equipment name/model
- Maker
- Maintenace type
- Frquency
- Spare parts required for th job

The data set is generated using Claude and contains 1756 records

## Install Requirements
Python above 3.9 version will work<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
add openai key in .env file

## RAG flow, RAG evaluation and retreival

The following results without boosting the index:
{'hit_rate': 0.8553530751708428, 'mrr': 0.6823731333839534}

With boosting;<br>
{'hit_rate': 0.8490888382687927, 'mrr': 0.7397254763712625}

I used Chat gpt 3.5 turbo, may using better LLm could imporove the hit rate and mmr

Best boosting paramters:<br>
boost = {
        'equipment_name': 2.2286308944548905,
        'maker': 1.3065317502078608,
        'type_of_maintenance': 2.7847555728963282,
        'frequency': 0.4028772934987217,
        'parts_required': 0.4007776344493833
    }

Using gpt-3.5-turbo among 1756 records, we have:<br>
- RELEVANT           0.428815
- PARTLY_RELEVANT    0.378132
- NON_RELEVANT       0.192483
- Non_Relevant       0.000569

The LLM explanation  considers one part as partial becuase query asks for parts. Therefore, partial answer can be considered as RELEVANT.

Here is sample question and explanation:
- Question: 'What parts are required for cleaning the condenser fan blade on the MFI2269FRZ?'
- Explanation: 'The generated answer only mentions a soft cloth as the part required for cleaning the condenser fan blade, which is not accurate. The question asks for all the parts required, not just one.'


For `gpt-4o-mini`, in a sample with 200 records, the results are:

- RELEVANT           0.428815
- PARTLY_RELEVANT    0.378132
- NON_RELEVANT       0.192483
- Non_Relevant       0.000569


## Interface
Using Flask framework to serve the api and Minsearch  from https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/blob/main/01-intro/minsearch.py

cmd: python app.py

### Question API
```
URL=http://localhost:5000
QUESTION="What parts are required for cleaning the condenser fan blade on the MFI2269FRZ?"
DATA='{
    "question": "'${QUESTION}'"
}'

curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "${DATA}" \
    ${URL}/question

Result:
{
  "answer": "Soft cloth.",
  "conversation_id": "b50da356-c62d-4991-b68d-dc942f253fa3",
  "question": "What parts are required for cleaning the condenser fan blade on the MFI2269FRZ?"
}
```
### Feedback API
```
$ ID="b50da356-c62d-4991-b68d-dc942f253fa3"
$ FEEDBACK_DATA='{
    "conversation_id": "'${ID}'",
    "feedback": 1
}'

$ curl -X POST     -H "Content-Type: application/json"     -d "${FEEDBACK_DATA}"     ${URL}/feedback
{
  "message": "Feedback received for conversation b50da356-c62d-4991-b68d-dc942f253fa3: 1"
}
```

## Code

The code for the application is in the [`tek_buddy`](tek_buddy) folder:

- [`app.py`] - the Flask API, the main entrypoint to the application
- [`rag.py`] - the main RAG logic for building the retrieving the data and building the prompt
- [`ingest.py`] - loading the data into the knowledge base
- [`minsearch.py`] - an in-memory search engine


## Notebooks
- directory notebooks contains various notebooks for expereiments  

## env file
```
